HTTPD Cookbook
=======================

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/chef-cookbooks/httpd](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/chef-cookbooks/httpd?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The HTTPD Cookbook is a Library Cookbook that provides resource
primitives for use in recipes. It is designed to be an example to
reference for creating highly re-usable cross platform cookbooks.

Scope
-----
This cookbook is concerned with
[The Apache HTTP Server](http://httpd.apache.org/), particularly those
shipped with F/OSS Unix and Linux distributions. It does not address
other httpd server implementations like Lighttpd, Nginx, or IIS.

Requirements
------------
- Chef 12.0.0 or higher
- Ruby 1.9 or higher (preferably from the Chef full-stack installer)
- Network accessible package repositories

Platform Support
----------------
The following platforms have been tested with Test Kitchen:

```

|                | 2.0 | 2.2 | 2.4 |
|----------------+-----+-----+-----|

```

Cookbook Dependencies
------------
- none!

Usage
-----
Place a dependency on the httpd cookbook in your cookbook's metadata.rb
```ruby
depends 'httpd', '~> 0.2'
```

Then, in a recipe:

```ruby
httpd_service 'default' do
  action [:create, :start]
end

httpd_config 'default' do
  source 'mysite.cnf.erb'
  notifies :restart, 'httpd_service[default]'
  action :create
end
```

Resources Overview
---------------------
### httpd_service

The `httpd_service` does minimal configuration to get the service up
and running. Its parameters can select and tune the multi-processing
module, along with a small selection of server-wide configuration
options such as listen_ports and run_user.

The `:create` action handles package installation, support
directories, socket files, and other operating system level concerns.
The internal configuration file contains just enough to get the
service up and running, then loads extra configuration from a conf.d
directory. Further configurations are managed with the `httpd_config` resource.

The `:start` action starts the service on the machine using the
appropriate provider for the platform. The `:start` action should be
omitted when used in recipes designed to build containers.

`httpd_service` supports multiple Apache instances on a single
machine, enabling advanced Apache configuration in scenarios where
multiple servers need different loaded modules and global
configurations.

#### Examples

    httpd_service 'default' do
      action :create
    end

    httpd_service 'instance-1' do
      listen_ports ['81', '82']
      action :create
    end

    httpd_service 'an websites' do
      instance_name 'bob'
      servername 'www.computers.biz'
      version '2.4'
      mpm 'event'
      threadlimit '4096'
      listen_ports ['1234']
      action :create
    end

#### Parameters
Most of the parameters on the `httpd_service` resource map to their
CamelCase equivalents found at
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/directives.html

- `contact` - The email address rendered into the main configuration file as the ServerAdmin directive.

- `hostname_lookups` - Enables DNS lookups on client IP addresses.
  Can be 'on' 'off' or 'double'. Defaults to 'off'.

- `instance` - A string name to identify the `httpd_service`
 instance. By convention,  this will result in configuration, log, and
 support directories being created and used in the form
 '/etc/instance-name', '/var/log/instance-name', etc. If set to
 'default', the platform native defaults are used.

- `keepalive` - Enables HTTP persistent connections. Values can be true or false.

- `keepalivetimeout` -  Amount of time the server will wait for
  subsequent requests on a persistent connection.

- `listen_addresses` - IP addresses that the server listens to.
  Defaults to ['0.0.0.0'].

- `listen_ports` - Ports that the server listens to. Defaults to
  ['80', '443'].  

- `log_level` - Controls the verbosity of the ErrorLog. Defaults to 'warn'.

- `maxclients` - Maximum number of connections that will be processed
  simultaneously. Valid only with prefork and worker MPMs.

- `maxconnectionsperchild` - Limit on the number of connections that
  an individual child server will handle during its life. Valid with
  Apache 2.4 prefork, worker and event MPMs.

- `maxkeepaliverequests` - Number of requests allowed on a persistent
  connection. Defaults to 100.

- `maxrequestsperchild` -  The Apache 2.2 version of
  maxconnectionsperchild. Still supported as of 2.4  

- `maxrequestworkers` - Maximum number of connections that will be
  processed simultaneously. Valid on prefork, worker, and event MPMs.

- `maxspareservers` - Maximum number of idle child server processes.
  Valid only for prefork MPM.

- `maxsparethreads` - Maximum number of idle threads. Valid only for
  worker and event MPMs.

- `minspareservers` - Minimum number of idle child server processes.
  Valid only for preform MPM.

- `minsparethreads` - Minimum number of idle threads available to
  handle request spikes. Valid only for worker and event MPMs.  

- `modules` - A list of initial Apache modules to be loaded inside the
  httpd_service instance. Defaults to Debian standard on 2.2 and 2.4.

- `mpm` - The Multi-Processing Module to use for the `httpd_service`
  instance. Values can be 'prefork', 'worker', and 'event'. Defaults
  to 'worker' for Apache 2.2 and 'event' for Apache 2.4.

- `package_name` - Name of the server package to install on the
machine using the system package manager. Defaults to 'apache2' on
Debian and 'httpd' on RHEL.

- `run_group` - System group to start the `httpd_service` as. Defaults
  to 'www-data' on Debian and 'apache' on RHEL.

- `run_user` - System user to start the `httpd_service` as. Defaults
  to 'www-data' on Debian and 'apache' on RHEL.

- `servername` - Hostname and port that the server uses to identify
  itself. Syntax: [scheme://]fully-qualified-domain-name[:port].
  Defaults to node['hostname'].

- `startservers` - Number of child server processes created at
  startup. Valid for prefork, worker, and event MPMs. Default value
  differs from MPM to MPM.

- `threadlimit` - Sets the upper limit on the configurable number of
  threads per child process. Valid on worker and event MPMs.

- `threadsperchild` - Number of threads created by each child process.
  Valid on worker and event MPMs.  

- `timeout` - Amount of time the server will wait for certain events
  before failing a request. Defaults to '400'

- `version` - Apache software version to use. Available options are
  '2.2', and '2.4', depending on platform. Defaults to latest
  available.

### httpd_module
The `httpd_module` resource is responsible ensuring that an Apache
module is installed on the system, as well as ensuring a load configuration
snippet is dropped off at the appropriate location.

#### Examples

    httpd_module 'ssl' do
      action :create
    end

    httpd_module 'el dap' do
      module_name 'ldap'
      action :create
    end

    httpd_module 'auth_pgsql' do
      instance 'instance-2'
      action :create
    end

#### Parameters
- `filename` - The filename of the shared object to be rendered into
  the load config snippet. This can usually be omitted, and defaults
  to a generated value looked up in an internal map.

- `httpd_version` - The version of the `httpd_service` this module is
  meant to be installed for. Useful on platforms that support multiple
  Apache versions. Defaults to the platform default.

- `instance` - The `httpd_service` name to drop the load snippet off
for. Defaults to 'default'.

- `module_name` - The module name to install. Defaults to the
  `httpd_module` name.


`package_name` - The package name the module is found in. By default,
this is looked up in an internal map.

### httpd_config
The `httpd_config` resource is a thin wrapper around the core Chef
template resource. Instead of a path parameter, `httpd_config` uses
the instance parameter to calculate where the config is dropped off.

#### Examples

    httpd_config 'mysite' do
      source 'mysite.erb'
      action :create
    end

    httpd_config 'computers dot biz ssl_config' do
      config_name 'ssl-config'
      httpd_instance 'computers_dot_biz'
      source 'ssl_config.erb'
      action :create
    end

#### Parameters
- `config_name` - The name of the config on disk

- `cookbook` - The cookbook that the source template is found in.
  Defaults to the current cookbook.  

- `httpd_version` - Used to calculate the configuration's disk path.
  Defaults to the platform's native Apache version.

- `instance` - The `httpd_service` instance the config is meant for.
  Defaults to 'default'

- `source` - The ERB format template source used to render the file.

- `variables` - A hash of variables passed to the underlying template
  resource
